I am conducting research to elucidate the origin of magnetic properties, such as coercivity, in magnetic materials by combining the differential phase contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (DPC-STEM) method, an electromagnetic field observation technique, with in situ magnetic field application. Coercivity is said to arise from the inhibition of domain wall motion by defects such as grain boundaries, making direct observation of domain wall motion essential for understanding the coercivity mechanism. Therefore, by employing in situ magnetic field DPC STEM to observe domain wall motion and analyze the interaction mechanisms between defects and domain walls, I aim to improve the properties of magnetic materials.
